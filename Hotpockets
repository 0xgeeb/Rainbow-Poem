Here is another test :)
And here is another one xD
I will live 

The morning rays of the Sun cling
On the upper bow of the Rainbow
Emerge after a moment â€˜s dusk
Brown Pelicans and Western Gulls
Fly beneath the lower bow
That touches the water
Send fishes into hiding
and birds chirping
And man to do caving 

The end

Random words to test out the process
