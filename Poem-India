No rainbows in the sky
No clouds and rains
No water till sun shine
I want to forget about all that
and i really enjoy riding on coding train
Because it is the coding train time.
Because when the train starts I cant stop
and when my dreams come true, I am gonna dance on hip hop like Mithun Da!
and do epic stuff!
I am an indian by heart
I enjoy the ride of coding train :)
And coder by soul!
I love not only git but also github,
Lets go to the pub!

India is my country
It is really a beautiful place

############PAKISTAN POEM #########

pak pak pakistan 
saf saf pakistan
her dum her pal azam hamara 
safeguard pakistan 
 heh :p
 As we have Pakistan and India in the same poem I have an addition to make :
 
We have Sushma Swaraj, You have Heena Rabbani Khar.

We have Devanagri, You have Pharsi.

We have Arijit singh, You have Atif Aslam.

We have you, and you have us!
